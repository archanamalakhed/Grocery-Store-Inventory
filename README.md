# Grocery-Story-Inventory
The project, Grocery Inventory Management System will help the business track sales activity and inventory easily to ensure that transactions are completed successfully. With the use of this system, the retrieval process will speed up and be able to generate immediate sales and inventory reports. The admin is the only person who can add, edit, and update the products while the customers can view the products they wish to purchase and pay accordingly.
